# General Usage 

```markdown
    - name: create-release
      uses: devwithkrishna/devwithkrishna-create-release-action@v1.0.0
      with:
        token: <your token reference here>
        pr_number: ${{ github.event.number }} #this will be passed from workflow 
        draft: true / false
        prerelease: true / false
        generate_release_notes: true / false
```

# How the releases are created
```shell
.
|-- Dockerfile
|-- LICENSE
|-- README.md
|-- action.yml
|-- create_new_release.py
|-- entrypoint.sh
|-- get_label_from_pr.py
|-- latest_release.py
|-- pyproject.toml
```

* This is specifically designed for Github usecase in which a Pull request is raised to merge a change from `Non main branch` to `main branch`

* Expects a Specific label in PR. label should be one among `first-release`, `major`, `minor`, `patch` (case sensitive). only one among these.

* When PR is merged to main branch and finds one among above lables, based on label it creates a new tag and generates the release

* The token provided should have sufficient previllage to create a tag and release.

* A PR should be merged to main branch to generate a release.

* You can have n number of labels on PR. But for this to work one from `first-release`, `major`, `minor`, `patch` should be present and only one.

* If the label `first-release` is found the release version will be `v1.0.0`. first release should only be used one time to create the first release version.

* If it finds `major` label, this will increase the major version by 1 and `resets patch and minor components`

* If it finds `minor` label, this will increase the minor version by 1 and `resets patch keeping major same`

* If it finds `patch` label, this will increase the patch version by 1 and `major and minor components are kept unchanged`
